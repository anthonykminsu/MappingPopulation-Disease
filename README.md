# Lab04: Mapping COVID-19 Cases and Population Density

## Overview
This lab showcases two interactive web maps using Mapbox GL JS. The first map visualizes COVID-19 case rates in Washington counties while the other displays population density in U.S. states.

## Maps
1. **COVID-19 Case Rates Map (`index.html`)**: This map displays the cumulative COVID-19 case rates per 10,000 people in each county. Data was collected in Washington state and last updated on October 25th, 2021.

2. **Population Density Map (`pop_density.html`)**: This map illustrates each U.S. state's population density (people per square mile).

## Features
- Interactive hover effects to display specific information tailored to the region.
- Color-coded regions based on data metrics (red and orange).
- Switch button to toggle between the COVID-19 Case Rates map and the Population Density map.

## Data
- **Sources**: The COVID-19 data was sourced from The New York Times and the Washington State Department of Health. Population estimates are from the Washington State Office of Financial Management and the U.S. Census Bureau.
- **Libraries Used**: Mapbox GL JS for map rendering and interactivity.
